history
=======
1.0-20130401      Initial release.
1.1_BETA-20130402 Eliminate need for external timeout binary, now
                    uses threading.Timer().
                  retval values have changed.
                  Tests updated and moved to test/.
                  Added installer.
                  Added runtime to result namedtuples.

install
=======

shell
=====
shell provides two user facing functions that execute shell commands and
return results in a normalized manner.

command() returns a namedtuple and multi_command() returns a namedtuple
generator:

result.command  <str>   command string
result.retval   <int>   retval
result.runtime  <float> runtime in seconds to 3 decimal places
result.output   <list>  output split by line, stripped of vertical and
                        horizontal whitespace

retval = 127 if command not found
retval = 256 on command timeout
retval = 257 on exception during execution or output collection

On retval 127 or 256 a standard description is returned as output. On retval
257, format_exc() is returned as output.

command(str command, int timeout=10)
====================================
Executes a command with a timeout. Returns the result as a namedtuple.

result = command('whoami', 2)
print result.command
print result.retval
print result.runtime
print result.output

multi_command(list commands, int timeout=10, int workers=4)
===========================================================
Executes commands concurrently with individual timeouts in a pool of
workers. Returns ordered results as a namedtuple generator.

results = multi_command(['whoami', 'uptime'], 2)
for result in results:
  print result.command
  print result.retval
  print result.runtime
  print result.output
